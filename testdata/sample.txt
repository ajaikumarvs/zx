This is a sample text file for testing the zx search tool.

Here are some patterns to search for:
- function definitions
- TODO comments
- error handling
- import statements

Some example code snippets:
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World")
}

// TODO: Add more test cases
func testFunction() error {
    return errors.New("test error")
}

This file contains multiple lines with different patterns.
You can search for specific words, regex patterns, or phrases.

Error handling is important in Go programming.
Functions should return errors when something goes wrong.

The search tool should highlight matches and show line numbers.
